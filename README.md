This is the stopwatch system that was developed for and used during Armada Run 2018. It allows its users to scan NFC tags and save timestamps when the tags are scanned. Each team gets their own NFC tag, for example via a sticker on a relay baton, and the last person in the team scans the tag in the goal area.

Currently, the documentation of the system is yet to be finalized.

`sudo systemctl start pcscd.service`
